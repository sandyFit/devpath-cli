## Overview

**DevPath CLI** is a command-line tool that analyzes your codebase, identifies technologies, and recommends tailored learning resources. Whether you're exploring a new project or sharpening your skills, DevPath helps you understand what you're working on — and what to learn next.

## Features

* **Project Analysis**: Detects tech stack, project structure, and code quality
* **Code Explanation**: Explains files and components at basic, intermediate, or advanced levels
* **Learning Resources**: Recommends tutorials and docs based on your stack
* **MongoDB Insights**: Recognizes database connections and explains schemas
* **React Support**: Provides detailed analysis for React JSX components

## Installation

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g devpath-cli
```

Or install locally in your project:

```bash
npm install devpath-cli
```

## Usage

### Analyze a Project

```bash
devpath analyze "/path/to/project"
```

**Options**

* `--depth <number>` – Set scan depth (default: 3)
* `--dir <path>` – Alternative directory path

### Explain Code

Break down and explain code simply:

```bash
devpath explain "/path/to/project" -f path/to/file.js -d intermediate
```

**Options**

* `-f, --file <path>` – Specify a file to explain
* `-c, --component <name>` – Focus on a specific component
* `-d, --detail <level>` – Choose explanation depth (`basic`, `intermediate`, `advanced`)

### Recommend Resources

Get tutorials, docs, and learning materials:

```bash
devpath recommend --list-techs
```

**Options**

* `--tech <technology>` – Recommend resources for a specific tech

---

### Interactive Learning

Start an AWS learning session:

```bash
devpath learn
```

**Options**

* `-i, --interactive` – Launch quiz-based guided learning
* `-r, --resources` – Show static resource recommendations
* `-c, --category <category>` – Focus on an AWS service area
